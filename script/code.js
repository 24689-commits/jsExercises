//Question 1

//1. Variable: It is a placeholder where we can temporarily store a value.
//2. Value: Data that was saved on a specific variable.
//3. Data type: The variable’s nature, or what kind of data are we going to store in our variable.
//4. Initialization: Is the act of creating a variable and assigning a value at the same
// time.

//5 var keyword: After you've declared it, you can keep assigning different values to
// it, which is totally wrong. var is an abbreviation for a variable.
// ● let: It reinforces the scope of a variable, which means that once a variable is
// declared, JavaScript will create its reference in our memory (RAM) as a
// container, and when we are done using it, it will be removed or deleted from
// memory.
// ● const: Once we create a variable using const, that means we don’t want to
// change its value, and we need to make sure that the variable has a value.
// Otherwise, we will get an error.

//6. Variable scope is the lifetime in the program. 
 //7. Use a for loop to iterate over an array.
 // Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.
 // A do-while loop is used when we don't know explicitly how many times the loop should run, and if we want the code to execute at least once.
 // Only use the for-each loop when you want to loop through all the values in an array or list. If you only want to loop through part of an array or list use a for loop instead

 //8. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution and variable scope is the lifetime in the program.
